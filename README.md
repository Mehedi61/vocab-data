# BanglaKit VocabData

BanglaKit VocabData aims to provide researchers, engineers and academics with
a repository of vocabulary for the Bengali language. The project aims to freely
distribute machine-friendly word-lists, lemmas and morphological analysis
of Bengali text (under permissive licenses).

## WIP

Work is in progress to build up the repository. Your help is appreciated!
